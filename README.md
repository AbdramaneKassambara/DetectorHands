Sure, here's a brief description of your project:
"This project involves hand detection using computer vision techniques.
It utilizes the cvzone library, which internally employs mediapipe for hand tracking.
The application captures video input, detects hands, and provides information about the detected hands, 
including the landmarks, bounding box, center, and type (left or right). The project serves as a foundation
for further interactions or applications involving hand gestures, as it identifies and distinguishes between
left and right hands in real-time."
